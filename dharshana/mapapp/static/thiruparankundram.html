            The Thiruparankundram Temple is famous for being one of the six "Arupadaiveedu" (abodes) of Lord Murugan, and for its unique rock-cut architecture carved from a single mountain. It is also well-known for the idols of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu facing each other, its sacredness for marriages, and a Muslim shrine to Sekunder.
